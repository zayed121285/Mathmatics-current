1/17/2015 : I TAKED IDEA ABOUT 	 THE P WHICH STAND FOR ROW EXANGES AND 
COLUMES EXHANGES AND HOW THE p IT ALWAYS EQUAL to the inverese of it in other
name it (symatric) and how it equal to it trqnspose and how if we multply
transpose we end with a symatric matrix and what is the proparites of symatric
and i got the idea of two victores on  R3 deminational space and how this victros can fill a whole plane and still trying to imagine and 
read about union and why it different of combination but 
combination of three victores fill a R3 diminational space while a plane 
which is a compinartion of two function and if we union it with
one line that has a sub space it will cause it that we just DELETED
all subspaces
